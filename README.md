Copies files to Amazon S3 as they are uploaded to the Media Library. Optionally configure Amazon CloudFront for faster delivery.

## Description

This plugin automatically copies images, videos, documents, and any other media added through WordPress' media uploader to [Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (S3). It then automatically replaces the URL to each media file with their respective S3 URL or, if you have configured [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), the respective CloudFront URL. Image thumbnails are also copied to S3 and delivered through S3/CloudFront.

Uploading files *directly* to your S3 account is not currently supported by this plugin. They are uploaded to your server first, then copied to S3. There is an option to automatically remove the files from your server once they are copied to S3 however.

If you're adding this plugin to a site that's been around for a while, your existing media files will not be copied or served from S3. Only newly uploaded files will be copied and served from S3.
